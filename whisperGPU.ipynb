      "0:00:00 Okay, I start. So it's interview number two with participant number four.\n",
      "0:00:07 Yeah.\n",
      "0:00:08 Thanks for coming.\n",
      "0:00:10 No worries, of course.\n",
      "0:00:11 So every interview we start with a very general basic question about what was your day like yesterday.\n",
      "0:00:20 And yesterday was a Sunday, so it was probably not that routine, like you know, the everyday work routine.\n",
      "0:00:27 But can you describe yesterday to me? What did you do?\n",
      "0:00:31 I woke up, well my child woke up around 6.30.\n",
      "0:00:37 And then it was my girlfriend's turn to take the child while the other person slept.\n",
      "0:00:42 So she did that, which is very nice.\n",
      "0:00:44 I slept till around 9 o'clock.\n",
      "0:00:48 They came in and then they slept. She sleeps around 9 o'clock until 11.\n",
      "0:00:55 And in the meantime I did some work.\n",
      "0:00:58 I also wrote some emails and I had some breakfast.\n",
      "0:01:08 It's not hard to say.\n",
      "0:01:10 And yeah, that was pretty much it for the morning.\n",
      "0:01:16 And then she woke up, my girlfriend and my baby woke up and I made her breakfast with some coffee and stuff.\n",
      "0:01:24 And then I said, hey, let's make some cookies today.\n",
      "0:01:29 So we went to the shop and we bought the stuff we need to make cookies.\n",
      "0:01:33 We came home, we made some cookies.\n",
      "0:01:37 And then she...\n",
      "0:01:42 And then... what else happened?\n",
      "0:01:46 Made the cookie mix.\n",
      "0:01:48 And then...\n",
      "0:01:51 Was the baby part of the making cookies?\n",
      "0:01:53 No, no.\n",
      "0:01:55 She was just sitting on the table talking to herself.\n",
      "0:02:00 And then basically we sat down and we said, OK, let's watch a movie.\n",
      "0:02:04 And then we watched Narnia, you know this? The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\n",
      "0:02:08 We watched that in the afternoon.\n",
      "0:02:11 I made some breakfast, some lunch, sorry, before.\n",
      "0:02:14 Some spicy taco Mexican beans on toast thing with avocado.\n",
      "0:02:22 And then I cooked dinner, made meatballs, vegan meatballs.\n",
      "0:02:29 And then I washed up and then we tried to see if we could watch the football, but we couldn't.\n",
      "0:02:36 The late match with England.\n",
      "0:02:38 Yeah, exactly. And then we watched a Danish series called Equinox, which is the thing on Netflix.\n",
      "0:02:44 Yes.\n",
      "0:02:46 We watched like two episodes of that and then I think we went to bed at like 10.\n",
      "0:02:51 Yes. How many naps did the baby have along the way?\n",
      "0:02:56 The baby had three naps.\n",
      "0:02:58 OK.\n",
      "0:02:59 So one long one, one around one o'clock and then another one around four o'clock.\n",
      "0:03:04 So do I hear a Sunday that is a little bit organized around these naps or routinized at least to take into account?\n",
      "0:03:14 I think the mornings are pretty routine.\n",
      "0:03:18 We don't really make much plans in the morning because you know she's going to go back to sleep.\n",
      "0:03:23 So normally like 12 o'clock our day starts, right?\n",
      "0:03:25 Yes.\n",
      "0:03:27 And depending on who has woken up first with the child, depends on who is helping out or doing stuff.\n",
      "0:03:38 OK.\n",
      "0:03:41 What did you do?\n",
      "0:03:44 It doesn't sound all that unfamiliar.\n",
      "0:03:47 It wasn't that exciting.\n",
      "0:03:48 No, but it's Sunday relaxing.\n",
      "0:03:50 Yeah.\n",
      "0:03:51 I wrestled a bear or something that I found in the woods.\n",
      "0:03:53 Next Sunday.\n",
      "0:03:55 Maybe next time.\n",
      "0:03:56 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:03:57 Do you feel like your rhythm has changed since your partner and child is now here?\n",
      "0:04:03 Yeah, a little bit.\n",
      "0:04:05 I make sure to get home earlier so that I can see my child before she leaves.\n",
      "0:04:10 I get up earlier around six, half past five depending on when she wakes up.\n",
      "0:04:16 So during work days you are in charge in the mornings so that your partner can sleep for a little bit.\n",
      "0:04:22 Yeah, something like that.\n",
      "0:04:23 We normally just take it as it is, but we try to at least do half-half.\n",
      "0:04:29 So in the mornings on work days I wake up and then sometimes she takes it in the week and we just kind of split it.\n",
      "0:04:36 We should probably talk about it, but there's no official days.\n",
      "0:04:40 It's just kind of how we feel on the day.\n",
      "0:04:43 Yeah.\n",
      "0:04:45 So getting up early is a new thing.\n",
      "0:04:49 Early, early.\n",
      "0:04:50 Laying with the child is a new thing.\n",
      "0:04:56 And also coming home early is a new thing as well.\n",
      "0:04:59 And trying to fit in.\n",
      "0:05:01 I normally go to the gym at like ten in the night, for example.\n",
      "0:05:06 So yeah, trying to fit that in with coming home, cooking dinner, looking after the baby for an hour.\n",
      "0:05:13 And then cooking dinner and then the baby goes to bed.\n",
      "0:05:16 And then normally we eat dinner, we watch like one hour or something.\n",
      "0:05:21 And then I normally go to the gym.\n",
      "0:05:24 So you haven't skipped your exercising routine.\n",
      "0:05:26 You just sleep a little less and work a little less.\n",
      "0:05:28 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:05:29 I'm not as going as much as I used to.\n",
      "0:05:33 But I try to go at least three times a week.\n",
      "0:05:37 And then I would say if I have to do some work, I do some work when the baby is asleep.\n",
      "0:05:43 Because she's pretty good.\n",
      "0:05:44 She just sleeps mainly through the night.\n",
      "0:05:46 And then she needs feeding once or twice in the night.\n",
      "0:05:49 And I would say...\n",
      "0:05:50 You cannot do that?\n",
      "0:05:51 Biologically, I'm a little bit stuck on that.\n",
      "0:05:55 So yeah, I would say it's changed a little bit.\n",
      "0:05:59 I would say that what's massively changed is that when I was...\n",
      "0:06:04 This time last year, for example, I was working in a restaurant.\n",
      "0:06:07 I think I told you about it, right?\n",
      "0:06:09 Every evening and pretty much every weekend to make ends meet.\n",
      "0:06:14 And obviously that's disappeared.\n",
      "0:06:17 So I find myself on Saturday and Sunday doing what you should do, which is relaxing a little bit.\n",
      "0:06:24 But at the same time, it also still feels weird to me to do that.\n",
      "0:06:29 Yeah.\n",
      "0:06:30 Last time, we talked a lot about you liking feeling busy, being busy.\n",
      "0:06:37 And not necessarily in a very calendar-like planned manner, but just...\n",
      "0:06:43 Day by day.\n",
      "0:06:44 Yes.\n",
      "0:06:45 Exactly.\n",
      "0:06:46 I hear some of the same.\n",
      "0:06:48 Like, okay, let's make cookies.\n",
      "0:06:49 It's not like you have a big schedule ahead of you for Sunday.\n",
      "0:06:54 And then at that time we do this and this.\n",
      "0:06:57 But keeping busy is in a different sense. It's more like relaxing stuff and maybe a little bit less work.\n",
      "0:07:02 Yeah, a little bit, I would say.\n",
      "0:07:05 Would I be able to see it in the apps that you have on your phones?\n",
      "0:07:08 Do you have new apps on your phone or have you deleted some?\n",
      "0:07:14 So maybe, I don't know, maybe you have something for kids or maybe you have something for...\n",
      "0:07:21 No, we don't actually watch that much TV with Mina.\n",
      "0:07:26 I have to admit.\n",
      "0:07:27 But it's my daughter.\n",
      "0:07:29 And how young is she?\n",
      "0:07:30 She's seven months.\n",
      "0:07:31 Yeah, okay.\n",
      "0:07:32 So, no, we don't actually have any apps on here.\n",
      "0:07:35 I haven't downloaded any apps.\n",
      "0:07:37 No.\n",
      "0:07:38 Do you recall that you've stopped using any apps since last time?\n",
      "0:07:51 I mean, I use, I think, maybe Instagram a little bit less because we switched over to TikTok for a strategy.\n",
      "0:07:58 Or try to promote a lot more on TikTok.\n",
      "0:08:01 We've also been rebuilding some stuff on the app.\n",
      "0:08:05 So I've been looking at the new stuff we're building.\n",
      "0:08:10 I got pissed off at Bold because they are fucking annoying.\n",
      "0:08:14 They are bastards.\n",
      "0:08:16 So you stopped using Bold?\n",
      "0:08:17 I did. I deleted them, but then I had to download it again.\n",
      "0:08:20 Damn it.\n",
      "0:08:24 Yeah.\n",
      "0:08:25 Maybe I've been checking my bank account more now that I spend more money with the kid.\n",
      "0:08:30 Yeah.\n",
      "0:08:31 I also have a point towards the end about banking and financial tracking.\n",
      "0:08:35 So maybe we'll get back to that as well.\n",
      "0:08:37 Yeah.\n",
      "0:08:38 So in a moment we'll look at your screen time data and what can be learned.\n",
      "0:08:45 Like just by looking at whatever you've sent me.\n",
      "0:08:48 Yeah.\n",
      "0:08:49 I just wanted also to follow the other thread of change that was kind of outlined by you at our last interview.\n",
      "0:08:58 Because one was bringing the family here and what that might do to stuff.\n",
      "0:09:04 The other thing had to do with the business.\n",
      "0:09:08 And you said something in the interview about making an end of year assessment to figure out whether you would go on with the company.\n",
      "0:09:20 Yeah, I tend to say this a lot.\n",
      "0:09:22 Okay.\n",
      "0:09:25 What's the status on that?\n",
      "0:09:27 Yeah, I mean we have investors that want to put in money.\n",
      "0:09:32 We miss a couple of hundred thousand crowns and then we can close it.\n",
      "0:09:36 We have like a lead investor from the Danish Business Angel Network.\n",
      "0:09:40 We also have some other opportunities as well that arise or arose.\n",
      "0:09:50 And I think we'll see what happens.\n",
      "0:09:55 But you're not leaving in Silingskip right now?\n",
      "0:09:58 No, I don't think so.\n",
      "0:10:00 I think we're actually going to redesign or rebrand a little bit and do something else.\n",
      "0:10:07 Or not do something else but do the same thing but just more.\n",
      "0:10:11 So instead of focusing on like tourism travelers, I think we're going to focus on like the everyday person.\n",
      "0:10:18 And try to bring in, I think I mentioned it last time, try to bring in like these rewards.\n",
      "0:10:23 Yes, like you can go buy a coffee at the local coffee shop.\n",
      "0:10:27 So you're rewarded for traveling on an airplane, why you're not rewarded for traveling on the metro.\n",
      "0:10:32 So I think as if international public transport card wasn't enough, like investors are like,\n",
      "0:10:40 okay, but what's next?\n",
      "0:10:43 So then you just have to go create what's next and say, hey, this is what we're going to do.\n",
      "0:10:49 And I think we get a lot more people like the idea of it a lot more than just having the payment.\n",
      "0:10:55 Which is fine.\n",
      "0:10:58 They're always just pushing.\n",
      "0:11:01 Okay, so it's not like there's a major personal or professional shift immediately in the pipeline here.\n",
      "0:11:08 I would say so. I mean, let's see.\n",
      "0:11:11 It's tough now that my co-founder is pregnant.\n",
      "0:11:14 A lot of work comes on me as well.\n",
      "0:11:18 I think for me as well, it's definitely, if we don't organize it in some sort of way,\n",
      "0:11:26 or at least close the investment, then I think for me, it's definitely like, okay, well, we need to,\n",
      "0:11:32 then I might do something else.\n",
      "0:11:35 Yes, so it has to be personally sustainable.\n",
      "0:11:37 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:11:38 And I think that's like, I've just been thinking a lot about it with my family and stuff.\n",
      "0:11:43 And it's not fair that I make the decision that I have.\n",
      "0:11:53 And then they have to also suffer.\n",
      "0:11:56 They're not suffering. They have a good life, but they also have to, we are prohibited by what we can do.\n",
      "0:12:02 Like go on holiday or just go away or just go out for dinner or whatever.\n",
      "0:12:07 I mean, we still have to...\n",
      "0:12:09 Because you have to work and because of making money.\n",
      "0:12:11 Yeah, exactly. Because I don't have the disposable income that an average person who makes that would.\n",
      "0:12:17 Yes.\n",
      "0:12:18 So I think...\n",
      "0:12:21 Some big life questions, blurring out the background.\n",
      "0:12:24 We'll see. I mean, we'll be all right.\n",
      "0:12:26 I'll figure it out.\n",
      "0:12:27 And I would say probably by next February, we should know a little bit more about where we're at and what it looks like.\n",
      "0:12:37 We have a lot of promising things, investment from the Danish business angels.\n",
      "0:12:42 And also we have some money from the European Space Agency.\n",
      "0:12:46 Oh, you got that. You won them.\n",
      "0:12:48 No, we didn't get them. But we have them like, it's a different entity.\n",
      "0:12:53 So it's like, yeah, there's a whole other thing on there.\n",
      "0:12:58 But there's like this, the Danish, the Ministry of Higher Education have like earmarked some money for us in the budget to build this together with the European Space Agency.\n",
      "0:13:11 So let's see if that comes off. And then there's also Innovation Fund.\n",
      "0:13:17 For some reason we've been rejected from Innovation Fund for like four times with the Innovation Fund program, which is super frustrating.\n",
      "0:13:26 But I mean, the business is like increasing and we're getting people to buy our product.\n",
      "0:13:32 And that's super nice, you know.\n",
      "0:13:34 But it's just about some of the biggest feedback we get is that like you shouldn't work with tourists.\n",
      "0:13:41 You should work with domestic people.\n",
      "0:13:43 And that's what you want me to do.\n",
      "0:13:46 I can do that.\n",
      "0:13:48 It's not a big thing for me.\n",
      "0:13:52 I know we would argue about it. But yeah.\n",
      "0:13:57 Okay.\n",
      "0:13:58 A lot of opinions.\n",
      "0:14:01 Let's talk about your screen time.\n",
      "0:14:03 So what would you think I could learn about you from looking at your screen time, your mobile use?\n",
      "0:14:11 I would say that I work a lot.\n",
      "0:14:18 I'm slightly maybe addicted to like just scrolling on TikTok sometimes.\n",
      "0:14:29 I think I just use it as like a way just to zone out, you know.\n",
      "0:14:34 And all of a sudden like half an hour is gone.\n",
      "0:14:40 And I think it's just because I don't have to think about it.\n",
      "0:14:44 We talked a little bit about that last time. It's actually a safe space or a relaxing space, right?\n",
      "0:14:49 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:14:52 Yeah, I work a lot.\n",
      "0:14:57 I would say that's pretty much it.\n",
      "0:14:59 Is that something that you...\n",
      "0:15:02 So I would agree.\n",
      "0:15:05 TikTok can be many things.\n",
      "0:15:07 And you obviously also use it for work.\n",
      "0:15:09 You wouldn't necessarily know that from looking at your app data.\n",
      "0:15:12 But you're right. It's gone up.\n",
      "0:15:15 But it's been high all the time.\n",
      "0:15:17 All the time that I followed you.\n",
      "0:15:19 And so what I see when I look at it over time.\n",
      "0:15:23 And I've had the pleasure of looking at your data since June.\n",
      "0:15:28 So I have like five months.\n",
      "0:15:30 November, something went wrong with the screenshot.\n",
      "0:15:33 So the files are empty.\n",
      "0:15:35 So I'm going to ask you to send them again.\n",
      "0:15:37 Okay.\n",
      "0:15:38 No worries.\n",
      "0:15:39 We'll figure out.\n",
      "0:15:40 I'll remind you.\n",
      "0:15:41 So what I can see is a fairly stable pattern.\n",
      "0:15:45 Five hours per day.\n",
      "0:15:47 Sometimes a little less.\n",
      "0:15:49 A little more during the summer break actually.\n",
      "0:15:51 And then a little less now.\n",
      "0:15:53 Maybe four hours per day on the mobile.\n",
      "0:15:58 Pickups.\n",
      "0:16:00 120 during the day.\n",
      "0:16:02 These are where you do it yourself.\n",
      "0:16:04 Notifications, a little less.\n",
      "0:16:06 So it's mostly more prompted by yourself than it's prompted by others.\n",
      "0:16:10 Probably just, okay, I need to send this.\n",
      "0:16:12 Okay, I need to do that.\n",
      "0:16:13 Okay.\n",
      "0:16:14 Yes.\n",
      "0:16:18 But it's a fairly stable pattern, which tells me that you are a guy with a fairly structured life.\n",
      "0:16:27 And some very clear routines, which we also talked about last time we spoke.\n",
      "0:16:32 Even though you're also like a very much an ad hoc person who just does things.\n",
      "0:16:37 But things look pretty much similar across the period.\n",
      "0:16:44 So there's one time during the entire period where something sneaks in that is weird.\n",
      "0:16:50 And that's Tuesday in week 41 where suddenly your camera is open for nine hours.\n",
      "0:16:57 You have one day where it's like now the camera app and it messes with the entire week.\n",
      "0:17:03 It's like just before the beginning of October.\n",
      "0:17:10 Do you have any recall of what that might be?\n",
      "0:17:13 So it's Tuesday week 41.\n",
      "0:17:15 That would be maybe 10th or 11th of October.\n",
      "0:17:20 What could it be?\n",
      "0:17:25 October.\n",
      "0:17:27 You said the beginning of October?\n",
      "0:17:28 Yes.\n",
      "0:17:29 10th or 11th, I think.\n",
      "0:17:32 It's a Tuesday.\n",
      "0:17:38 Nine hours.\n",
      "0:17:41 I was like maybe you'd been traveling or something like that.\n",
      "0:17:44 No, the camera app says nine hours for that week.\n",
      "0:17:47 Nine hours for that week, but then there's a peak in your screen time on that Tuesday.\n",
      "0:17:51 So I figure that the camera must have been used excessively that day.\n",
      "0:18:00 It could be screen recordings.\n",
      "0:18:02 It could be.\n",
      "0:18:03 Because I probably screen record a lot of stuff to send to the developers and say,\n",
      "0:18:07 Hey, this is fucked or this is fucked.\n",
      "0:18:10 Okay.\n",
      "0:18:13 Why is it October?\n",
      "0:18:21 Does camera also like photos as well?\n",
      "0:18:23 No, just the camera.\n",
      "0:18:25 I think it's screen recordings.\n",
      "0:18:29 Makes sense.\n",
      "0:18:30 So maybe there's been some kind of evaluation that day.\n",
      "0:18:35 Yeah.\n",
      "0:18:36 Okay.\n",
      "0:18:39 I send it to the developers.\n",
      "0:18:40 And that was July.\n",
      "0:18:52 August.\n",
      "0:19:04 Nine hours.\n",
      "0:19:05 That's next level.\n",
      "0:19:07 It could just be a mistake in the data.\n",
      "0:19:09 I think it's also October.\n",
      "0:19:13 Maybe I was going to, maybe I was in, I think I might have been in Bulgaria.\n",
      "0:19:20 It could also have been a holiday kind of thing or something where you just took it.\n",
      "0:19:23 It was work, but this is probably, this is the 26th of October.\n",
      "0:19:30 That's way later.\n",
      "0:19:35 Because I recorded a lot.\n",
      "0:19:38 When was this?\n",
      "0:19:40 This is the mobility summit.\n",
      "0:19:41 I had to go talk.\n",
      "0:19:47 When is this picture?\n",
      "0:19:49 This is cute.\n",
      "0:19:55 Nine.\n",
      "0:19:58 No.\n",
      "0:19:59 No.\n",
      "0:20:00 I mean, like for example, we went to an event on the, but this is the 12th.\n",
      "0:20:04 But I think it must have been the screen recording.\n",
      "0:20:06 Okay.\n",
      "0:20:07 So apart from that, then the stable pattern is that the ones that you use the most, TikTok,\n",
      "0:20:12 Skippit and internal Skippit, which I take must be LinkedIn, WhatsApp.\n",
      "0:20:20 This was also what you told me in the first interview before I'd even seen your data.\n",
      "0:20:23 So you knew.\n",
      "0:20:25 I'm so boring.\n",
      "0:20:26 I apologize.\n",
      "0:20:27 No.\n",
      "0:20:28 Yeah.\n",
      "0:20:29 TikTok, that has increased at the expense of Instagram, you said.\n",
      "0:20:34 And I think that's actually right, even though Instagram is still fairly high, but it's because you're moving marketing to that platform.\n",
      "0:20:41 Yeah, we're trying to figure out TikTok.\n",
      "0:20:43 Also, I think also the fact that I have more free time, I also spend some of it on TikTok.\n",
      "0:20:50 Like, for example, if my girlfriend is feeding the baby in the room and she's putting her to bed because she only sleeps with the nipple at the moment, then I just, if I have some free time, I watch TikTok.\n",
      "0:21:04 Yeah.\n",
      "0:21:05 But also moving away company-wise, so more marketing on TikTok as well.\n",
      "0:21:11 Yeah.\n",
      "0:21:12 Yeah.\n",
      "0:21:13 Okay, so that explains it.\n",
      "0:21:14 And why LinkedIn?\n",
      "0:21:16 Why so much time on LinkedIn?\n",
      "0:21:18 Why so much time on LinkedIn?\n",
      "0:21:20 Just because we reach out to investors on LinkedIn, I message connections on LinkedIn, LinkedIn people with public transport entities, hotel guys, all of these jets.\n",
      "0:21:40 We use LinkedIn mainly.\n",
      "0:21:43 Okay.\n",
      "0:21:44 And also I'm posting on LinkedIn as well.\n",
      "0:21:45 Okay.\n",
      "0:21:46 For the company.\n",
      "0:21:47 And then WhatsApp?\n",
      "0:21:48 That would be probably texting my CTO, like my technical guy, and also texting my girlfriend.\n",
      "0:21:54 We use WhatsApp.\n",
      "0:21:55 Okay.\n",
      "0:21:56 So it's both internal communication in the company and it's private coordination.\n",
      "0:21:59 Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:00 Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:01 You can call it that.\n",
      "0:22:02 It sounds a lot better when you say internal communication.\n",
      "0:22:05 It's more like, hey, the fucking app is down.\n",
      "0:22:07 What's going on?\n",
      "0:22:08 What do we do?\n",
      "0:22:09 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:22:10 Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:11 But I mean, I think it confirms the pattern, you know, you like to keep busy.\n",
      "0:22:17 You spend your phone a lot and you also said last time, I'm sorry, it's not like I want to hold you up on whatever you said last time, but it's just, you actually said that your laptop is your primary working device.\n",
      "0:22:31 So I figure if you use your phone a lot for work and you use it five hours a day, you work a lot, you keep yourself quite busy.\n",
      "0:22:40 Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:41 Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:42 Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:43 Too much maybe.\n",
      "0:22:44 No, it's not like, it's not like...\n",
      "0:22:46 You're going to have phone...\n",
      "0:22:48 Excessive compared to other people in our study.\n",
      "0:22:51 What do you think of four to five hours per day?\n",
      "0:22:53 Do you think that's...\n",
      "0:22:54 On the phone?\n",
      "0:22:55 Yeah.\n",
      "0:22:58 I think it's a lot, right?\n",
      "0:23:01 But I think also nowadays apps in general are nudging you towards being on the phone.\n",
      "0:23:17 So like for example, Instagram, you can't upload anything unless you're on Instagram, like on the phone channel.\n",
      "0:23:22 Or for example, LinkedIn is sending you notifications via the app or TikTok, it's the same, it's easier.\n",
      "0:23:32 I actually don't think you can upload TikTok via the web platform, right?\n",
      "0:23:36 But you're prompted for engagement constantly through the mobile phone.\n",
      "0:23:40 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:23:41 And I would say also that sometimes it's easier to edit by the mobile phone and if you start sending files via your computer to your phone, it can lose quality and stuff like this.\n",
      "0:23:54 So it's just important that you do a lot more work for your phone.\n",
      "0:24:00 Yeah.\n",
      "0:24:01 So I would say that it can be a better solution if you want to do some professional work, but also these apps are nudging you to do more for your phone.\n",
      "0:24:15 Like when your laptop is closed, it's closed and I can't hear that I'm getting a notification on LinkedIn.\n",
      "0:24:20 No.\n",
      "0:24:21 When my phone is here, okay, I got a notification now from my technical lead.\n",
      "0:24:28 Yeah.\n",
      "0:24:29 Now I have to pick it up and look at it.\n",
      "0:24:31 Yeah.\n",
      "0:24:32 And then reply.\n",
      "0:24:33 Yeah.\n",
      "0:24:34 And you do get a lot of notifications as well.\n",
      "0:24:36 I do?\n",
      "0:24:37 Yeah, you do.\n",
      "0:24:38 Like just below 100 a day where people want to do something, right?\n",
      "0:24:44 People or apps, something wants something from you.\n",
      "0:24:46 But you also pick it up quite a lot by yourself.\n",
      "0:24:49 Yeah.\n",
      "0:24:50 How many times do they say I pick it up?\n",
      "0:24:52 Around 120 times per day.\n",
      "0:24:56 Yeah, but maybe that's me sending out orders.\n",
      "0:24:59 Yeah.\n",
      "0:25:00 Like 120 times a day and then receiving those orders, right?\n",
      "0:25:05 Yeah.\n",
      "0:25:06 I think you had a message.\n",
      "0:25:08 Yeah, I was just checking that the recording was still on.\n",
      "0:25:11 Yeah, that one.\n",
      "0:25:12 Is there anything surprising about the numbers?\n",
      "0:25:18 I think you don't realize how much it is.\n",
      "0:25:22 Like you don't realize it until you pick it up or you get a notification 100 times a day.\n",
      "0:25:27 And I think actually sometimes you can also say to yourself, okay,\n",
      "0:25:34 but I think it's also because you get a lot of shit sent through to your phone, right?\n",
      "0:25:39 Like I get emails from stuff and I look at it and I'm like, okay, just delete.\n",
      "0:25:45 I think I must delete.\n",
      "0:25:46 And it's also my own fault.\n",
      "0:25:48 I need to spend the time going through like any potential list that I've signed up to.\n",
      "0:25:52 I think I must delete like 20 emails a day from just crap.\n",
      "0:25:56 Yeah.\n",
      "0:25:57 You know, stuff that gets sent to me that I don't really need in my life.\n",
      "0:26:01 But they somehow found my email so they just send, send, send.\n",
      "0:26:06 Yeah.\n",
      "0:26:09 And I think without that it would be a lot quieter.\n",
      "0:26:15 Yeah.\n",
      "0:26:19 So if you think about it, you know, you're at a meeting or you're working with a laptop\n",
      "0:26:24 and then every couple of minutes either you have to check something on your phone\n",
      "0:26:28 or someone else wants you to respond to something.\n",
      "0:26:32 Is that a fair description do you think of?\n",
      "0:26:35 Yeah, I would say so.\n",
      "0:26:36 Does it provide a lot of distractions or not just distractions because it's also, you know,\n",
      "0:26:41 you're turning to take action on some points, right?\n",
      "0:26:45 Yeah, I think it's also about the way that the apps are set up in terms of structurally.\n",
      "0:26:51 So what you see in like, for example, an email.\n",
      "0:26:55 When you send out an email, you often try to fit quite a lot of information in one text, right?\n",
      "0:27:00 When you're writing on Slack or you're writing on WhatsApp or you're writing on whatever,\n",
      "0:27:04 it's just normally like instant messaging.\n",
      "0:27:06 Yeah.\n",
      "0:27:07 So of course then it's a boom, boom, boom, boom.\n",
      "0:27:08 You know, it's creating more of these notifications and more of these distractions.\n",
      "0:27:16 So I think it's also about the way that the apps are constructed that also create more of a pickup culture.\n",
      "0:27:28 You know, because I think with an email you're like, oh, I'll read it tomorrow.\n",
      "0:27:34 It's not that important.\n",
      "0:27:35 No.\n",
      "0:27:36 It's not like, oh, I sent you an email.\n",
      "0:27:38 You can just take a look at it tomorrow.\n",
      "0:27:39 No worries.\n",
      "0:27:40 So there's something about the temporal logic or structure to it that, you know, prompts for quicker communications.\n",
      "0:27:49 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:27:50 And I think at the same time it's good because we have it.\n",
      "0:27:53 And then I can just, I don't have to say like, hi, Amir, thanks for your email or thanks for your message.\n",
      "0:27:59 I believe we should cover this strategy.\n",
      "0:28:01 It's just like, yeah, if you think it's best, cool.\n",
      "0:28:05 Yes.\n",
      "0:28:06 So it's also something that gets stuff out of the way without too much excess.\n",
      "0:28:09 Exactly.\n",
      "0:28:10 It's laziness, but at the same time does it create, does it help you or does it actually, let's say, create more work on your plate?\n",
      "0:28:19 If communication was only done through email, would it be better that way?\n",
      "0:28:23 Or would you spend more time answering emails because you have to fit so much information in one?\n",
      "0:28:29 And then would you send like 10 emails because you, oh, yeah, and by the way, oh, yeah, and by the way.\n",
      "0:28:34 So I think you have to see which is best.\n",
      "0:28:40 Is there anything about your phone users that you are particularly happy about or particularly intrigued to change?\n",
      "0:28:53 Maybe I should be on TikTok less.\n",
      "0:28:55 Why?\n",
      "0:28:57 Why?\n",
      "0:28:58 Yeah, why?\n",
      "0:28:59 Because it's shit and it's just...\n",
      "0:29:03 But it's also breathing space, no?\n",
      "0:29:05 Yeah, but it's also just crap.\n",
      "0:29:06 It's just people doing stuff and should you really give it your attention?\n",
      "0:29:15 But at the same time, your body kind of craves it, right?\n",
      "0:29:17 So all this kind of like numbingness of the brain.\n",
      "0:29:23 So I think you have to manage it.\n",
      "0:29:26 Of course, it's important to be aware.\n",
      "0:29:33 I'm not saying it's a bad thing necessarily to use it, but it's also important that you are aware that you don't become like addicted to the scoring.\n",
      "0:29:44 Do you feel like you are addicted to it?\n",
      "0:29:46 No, I don't feel addicted to it.\n",
      "0:29:48 I think I just go without it, but then again, I think it's without getting too deep and philosophical, I think what is addiction?\n",
      "0:30:04 I mean, because, for example, if I'm sitting here in my mind and I'll just be sitting there going, I should check TikTok.\n",
      "0:30:11 Is that an addiction?\n",
      "0:30:13 Like the fact that it even enters my brain, does that count as addiction?\n",
      "0:30:18 It's like cigarettes, right?\n",
      "0:30:20 Oh, I could do with a cigarette.\n",
      "0:30:22 And sometimes, for example, when I'm drinking, I have a cigarette or whatever, right?\n",
      "0:30:27 And then sometimes in the day I'm like, I could really do with a cigarette.\n",
      "0:30:31 Does that make me addicted to cigarettes?\n",
      "0:30:33 I mean, I don't smoke.\n",
      "0:30:36 I smoke sometimes on the weekends if I have a beer or whatever.\n",
      "0:30:42 I think what is addiction?\n",
      "0:30:44 Is it just the thought or is it like something you're trying to get the pleasure from it, right?\n",
      "0:30:50 And I mean, like allowing yourself to give in to that thought or that pleasure, is that addiction?\n",
      "0:31:01 That's the question I'm asking.\n",
      "0:31:03 It's a good question.\n",
      "0:31:04 Or is it just that, hey, we're only human.\n",
      "0:31:07 And yeah, OK, you know, if you're smoking 40 a day, you probably do.\n",
      "0:31:13 If you're smoking a cigarette with a beer on the weekend and the rest of the week you don't smoke, does that make you an addict?\n",
      "0:31:19 At the same time, I also associate having a beer and cigarette.\n",
      "0:31:24 Or I associate TikTok with...\n",
      "0:31:26 Relaxation.\n",
      "0:31:28 For example, right?\n",
      "0:31:29 So is that addiction or is that... what is that?\n",
      "0:31:34 Research-wise, I would tend to be cautious talking about addiction.\n",
      "0:31:39 So I'm merely asking because it was the word that you used yourself.\n",
      "0:31:43 And it is the word that people use around screen time and their worries around screen time.\n",
      "0:31:48 I think it's only human.\n",
      "0:31:50 And I think we also talked a little bit about that last time, you know, having some kind of breathing space.\n",
      "0:31:55 Now it's TikTok.\n",
      "0:31:57 In the 50s, it was the newspaper, right?\n",
      "0:32:00 So it's like, you know, you have certain artifacts that you use to take a break from the world.\n",
      "0:32:07 And now it happens to be for you, TikTok.\n",
      "0:32:10 It could also be something else.\n",
      "0:32:13 But you would like to use it a little less, you were saying.\n",
      "0:32:16 Yeah, I think so.\n",
      "0:32:17 Just sometimes I'm like, OK.\n",
      "0:32:19 I think, and to be totally honest and open, like sometimes I'm like, OK, I'll just watch TikTok until...\n",
      "0:32:25 Because two is my lucky number.\n",
      "0:32:28 I'll just watch TikTok until like two minutes past or 12 minutes past or 22 minutes past.\n",
      "0:32:33 I don't know why.\n",
      "0:32:34 I just get myself in a huge hurry a little bit more, right?\n",
      "0:32:36 Yes.\n",
      "0:32:37 But then you also set a limit in a sense.\n",
      "0:32:39 Yes.\n",
      "0:32:40 Yes.\n",
      "0:32:41 And this gets me to the next question, which is also about, you know, I mean, looking at the apps that you have on your phone\n",
      "0:32:50 and knowing that you lead a quite busy life and rereading what you said in the first interview, namely that you're not very structured\n",
      "0:33:00 and that you're not a planner, but it's all in your head and then you just take action right away and get stuff out of the way.\n",
      "0:33:06 I do see from your phone that you don't have a lot of apps.\n",
      "0:33:11 You have one folder that's about, you know, related products.\n",
      "0:33:15 Yeah, exactly.\n",
      "0:33:17 But you don't have anything that helps you plan or get an overview over the busy work life.\n",
      "0:33:25 No, I have my calendar.\n",
      "0:33:26 Still not necessary?\n",
      "0:33:27 Yeah, you have your calendar.\n",
      "0:33:28 I have it on the phone.\n",
      "0:33:29 Yeah.\n",
      "0:33:30 Sometimes I look at it.\n",
      "0:33:31 Yeah.\n",
      "0:33:32 But it's not something that hits me as, you know, central to your life.\n",
      "0:33:38 No.\n",
      "0:33:39 There's a lot of products out there to help, you know, trace productivity or tasks or whatever, but they don't take up any particularly central role.\n",
      "0:33:51 No, I get the feeling that it's more work to download these apps and to structure your life around those apps than it actually is just to get on with it.\n",
      "0:33:59 Yeah.\n",
      "0:34:00 Like, if I was to download the app and then I was to spend time on actually inputting the data that I needed to in order to bring the structure,\n",
      "0:34:06 I could actually just spend the time, like, doing it.\n",
      "0:34:11 Yeah.\n",
      "0:34:12 Does that make sense?\n",
      "0:34:13 It makes sense.\n",
      "0:34:14 Yeah.\n",
      "0:34:15 So I think that's my dissatisfaction.\n",
      "0:34:17 We talked about it last time that I just don't really like people selling me stuff so much.\n",
      "0:34:24 And you're right, there's a lot of labor or work imbued with trying to make various types of digital aids help you.\n",
      "0:34:37 Yeah.\n",
      "0:34:38 Okay.\n",
      "0:34:39 Let's then talk about second theme, work and tracking.\n",
      "0:34:43 Yeah.\n",
      "0:34:44 And I'm going back to your pitch deck where you track your work.\n",
      "0:34:47 So you said something about you track how you want to make money, transport partners, where you're at, the reward scheme, Earth Miles,\n",
      "0:34:57 how many tickets you've sold, how many partners you have.\n",
      "0:35:04 Is that a fair description of what you track about your own work?\n",
      "0:35:08 Yeah.\n",
      "0:35:09 Yeah.\n",
      "0:35:10 We don't track the users.\n",
      "0:35:12 Do you track, like, the hours you spend working or how much time you spend on meetings versus actual app development or marketing?\n",
      "0:35:22 I see it sometimes in Google Meets that I spend, like, 25 hours on meetings this week and I'm like, oh, that's a lot.\n",
      "0:35:29 And then I just kind of go back to work.\n",
      "0:35:31 Okay.\n",
      "0:35:32 But then how do you get to see that in Google Meet?\n",
      "0:35:34 It comes up.\n",
      "0:35:35 It's on the side, right?\n",
      "0:35:36 Yeah.\n",
      "0:35:37 So you get a notification.\n",
      "0:35:38 No, you don't get a notification.\n",
      "0:35:39 No?\n",
      "0:35:40 You can see.\n",
      "0:35:42 Yeah.\n",
      "0:35:46 And you do notice that?\n",
      "0:35:47 Sometimes.\n",
      "0:35:48 Yeah.\n",
      "0:35:49 Only when I'm like, I just look at it and I'm like, oh, what's that bar?\n",
      "0:35:52 Then I just look at it.\n",
      "0:35:54 It's more insights.\n",
      "0:35:55 Yeah.\n",
      "0:35:56 It probably won't though because I don't have internet.\n",
      "0:35:59 But yeah.\n",
      "0:36:00 I guess you can get more insights there.\n",
      "0:36:02 Yeah.\n",
      "0:36:03 About what?\n",
      "0:36:04 About your hours.\n",
      "0:36:07 I shouldn't mention.\n",
      "0:36:08 I need to connect it.\n",
      "0:36:10 You can find out.\n",
      "0:36:11 Okay.\n",
      "0:36:19 It's my, I don't know why the internet wasn't working.\n",
      "0:36:27 It is not always stable around here.\n",
      "0:36:31 Anyhow.\n",
      "0:36:32 Yeah, I know.\n",
      "0:36:36 Apparently it's just collapsed.\n",
      "0:36:42 Okay.\n",
      "0:36:44 One to one, 10 hours.\n",
      "0:36:45 Right.\n",
      "0:36:46 Focus time.\n",
      "0:36:47 Yeah.\n",
      "0:36:49 But I could do, yeah.\n",
      "0:36:50 I'm pretty sure you can get screen time on the laptop as well.\n",
      "0:36:52 Yeah.\n",
      "0:36:53 You can?\n",
      "0:36:54 Yeah, I'm pretty sure.\n",
      "0:36:55 Yeah.\n",
      "0:36:57 So this is actually, do you know Microsoft's productivity tracking tool?\n",
      "0:37:03 It used to be called Microsoft My Analytics, now maybe it's called Viva.\n",
      "0:37:06 Called what?\n",
      "0:37:07 Viva, Microsoft Viva.\n",
      "0:37:09 It's built into the 365 package.\n",
      "0:37:12 It also divides your time into focus time and meetings and whatever and whatnot.\n",
      "0:37:16 So you get reports on, you know, how you spend your time.\n",
      "0:37:23 Actually, but this is, yeah, I didn't know about that, but this is a Mac, right?\n",
      "0:37:28 Yeah.\n",
      "0:37:29 I don't know if we have the same.\n",
      "0:37:34 No, there is a screen time.\n",
      "0:37:44 Yes.\n",
      "0:37:47 This is just app, right?\n",
      "0:37:48 Yeah.\n",
      "0:37:51 Show categories.\n",
      "0:37:53 But this is on my phone, I think.\n",
      "0:37:55 No, it cannot be.\n",
      "0:37:57 Okay.\n",
      "0:37:58 Because it looks different on your phone.\n",
      "0:38:00 What is like the most, it could be this.\n",
      "0:38:04 So you spend time browsing Slack.\n",
      "0:38:08 Finding stuff.\n",
      "0:38:09 I'm an old man, you know?\n",
      "0:38:11 Yeah.\n",
      "0:38:12 Pickups.\n",
      "0:38:16 But in your calendar, there's actually time tracking.\n",
      "0:38:20 Yeah.\n",
      "0:38:21 It does that automatically for you.\n",
      "0:38:22 Yeah.\n",
      "0:38:23 And sometimes you notice it.\n",
      "0:38:25 You said, and then it's like, okay, that's a lot.\n",
      "0:38:27 Is it something that you, is it an insight that you use in any manner?\n",
      "0:38:33 It's just there.\n",
      "0:38:35 It's just there.\n",
      "0:38:36 I don't really look at it.\n",
      "0:38:38 I mean, again, I think it's about saying, okay, I can spend the time to take a look at it, but I don't have the time.\n",
      "0:38:46 No.\n",
      "0:38:47 What about your employees?\n",
      "0:38:49 Do they track their time or?\n",
      "0:38:51 No.\n",
      "0:38:53 No?\n",
      "0:38:54 No.\n",
      "0:38:55 It's very organic in the sense that, you know.\n",
      "0:38:58 Should they be tracking their time?\n",
      "0:38:59 No, I'm not sure.\n",
      "0:39:00 I'm just asking.\n",
      "0:39:01 Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "0:39:02 No.\n",
      "0:39:03 No, I think it's just, hey, like I trust that they do the hours that we pay them for.\n",
      "0:39:06 Yes.\n",
      "0:39:07 I don't need to get them to send me a screenshot of their working week.\n",
      "0:39:12 No.\n",
      "0:39:13 Like it's, how do you say?\n",
      "0:39:14 No.\n",
      "0:39:15 So anything that you might encounter in broader discussions about workplace monitoring and HR, people management,\n",
      "0:39:31 you would find, you know, ideas about ways to optimize work by either supporting your employees' mental health or their work-life balance or their ability to focus or whatever.\n",
      "0:39:49 Organizing their tasks and saying, hey, don't take this, I'll take this, and you take that, and I'll take that.\n",
      "0:39:54 Yes.\n",
      "0:39:55 You don't do that in the company.\n",
      "0:39:57 I do do that.\n",
      "0:39:58 You do do that?\n",
      "0:39:59 Okay.\n",
      "0:40:00 So, for example, if my co-founder is sick right now or she's pregnant and she's finding it a little bit tough to do all the tasks, then I try to distribute it to the team.\n",
      "0:40:12 But it's not based on data.\n",
      "0:40:13 It's simply based on what people say.\n",
      "0:40:15 Yeah.\n",
      "0:40:16 Yeah.\n",
      "0:40:18 So, again, data is excess, really.\n",
      "0:40:20 You don't need it.\n",
      "0:40:23 I mean, we look at, for example, like we go through the analytics of TikTok and Instagram or which channels like it, who followed us, who liked the video, what kind of people.\n",
      "0:40:32 I think that's important when you're trying to reach your target audience.\n",
      "0:40:35 Yes.\n",
      "0:40:36 To understand who's engaging.\n",
      "0:40:37 And if you're communicating about an app, then it's important that you are, from a marketing perspective, using analytics.\n",
      "0:40:45 But I would say that from internally, for such a small team, it's a little bit nonsensical to spend the time on going through it all.\n",
      "0:40:54 Like, you also get offered all of these things from external consultants.\n",
      "0:40:59 Oh, take a leadership course.\n",
      "0:41:00 Do this.\n",
      "0:41:01 And you decide, well, right now it's not something that's priority.\n",
      "0:41:04 My leadership course is making sure that these guys have a paycheck.\n",
      "0:41:07 Yeah.\n",
      "0:41:08 And then I'll take a look at the leadership course when things are a little bit more settled.\n",
      "0:41:11 Yeah.\n",
      "0:41:13 So there's something about data being useful for the outside, right?\n",
      "0:41:22 Yeah.\n",
      "0:41:23 But not for how you organize work or ensure, I don't know, well-being and productivity in the workplace in that sense.\n",
      "0:41:34 No, I think I just talk to people.\n",
      "0:41:35 Yeah.\n",
      "0:41:36 And if I see that they're upset, I'd say, hey, let's have a chat.\n",
      "0:41:38 What's up?\n",
      "0:41:39 What's going on?\n",
      "0:41:40 Yeah.\n",
      "0:41:41 What are your thoughts?\n",
      "0:41:42 I just want to track people.\n",
      "0:41:45 I mean, sometimes I notice that someone hasn't been online all day, especially nowadays.\n",
      "0:41:52 Then I'm like, hey, is everything okay?\n",
      "0:41:53 I send them a message.\n",
      "0:41:54 Is everything okay?\n",
      "0:41:55 Yeah.\n",
      "0:41:56 And then they reply.\n",
      "0:41:57 Well, I can't do much about it.\n",
      "0:41:58 Is it okay?\n",
      "0:41:59 So then I just try to sort of say, oh, what are you doing today?\n",
      "0:42:04 What are your tasks?\n",
      "0:42:07 Let me know if you need some help.\n",
      "0:42:09 Yeah.\n",
      "0:42:12 Do you think that's unique to SkipIt and you?\n",
      "0:42:16 Or do you think that has to do with the size of the company?\n",
      "0:42:22 I think it's the size of the company.\n",
      "0:42:23 And I also think it's also, of course, obviously every CEO runs his company how they want in some sort of way.\n",
      "0:42:30 Yeah.\n",
      "0:42:31 And my way to run a company is not so, can we say, not signing up to every platform because it optimizes your work.\n",
      "0:42:43 You know, like pay us X amount of money a month.\n",
      "0:42:47 Of course, we sign up to the essentials like Billy and stuff to do all the accounting.\n",
      "0:42:54 Yeah.\n",
      "0:42:55 But in terms of optimizing staff by doing this or like at the moment we're too small.\n",
      "0:43:04 I think if we were to get to like 15, maybe 20 employees, yeah, maybe we'd have to look into like, okay, how do we work?\n",
      "0:43:13 And also everybody works different.\n",
      "0:43:15 You know, like some people like to do like Kanban boards.\n",
      "0:43:19 Do you know what they are?\n",
      "0:43:20 I don't know.\n",
      "0:43:21 It's like basically it's learned, used a lot in technical teams where it's like to be done, in progress, done, finalized, whatever.\n",
      "0:43:34 These four parameters and then you just kind of lay them out.\n",
      "0:43:38 And I think that's, yeah, so for me, that's, some people like that way to work and some people don't.\n",
      "0:43:46 Okay.\n",
      "0:43:47 Some people like to have them and therefore I cater.\n",
      "0:43:50 So our technical guy who just wrote me, he really likes Kanban.\n",
      "0:43:54 So I said, hey, create your own because we did try to bring in, I remember once like we were such a small company and we had one person who was like, I need to know what's going on everywhere.\n",
      "0:44:04 And I was just like, you don't need to know.\n",
      "0:44:06 Like, as long as we get stuff done, that's all you need to know.\n",
      "0:44:09 You need to concentrate on your thing and that's it.\n",
      "0:44:11 And let me have like the overview.\n",
      "0:44:13 I know it sounds a bit dictatorship-ish, but it's also like, I think the problem is if you always try to cater to everybody's needs, you end up just running around in circles.\n",
      "0:44:24 And sometimes you need to just say, hey, listen, I understand, I can respect your decision, but this is the way it's going to be.\n",
      "0:44:31 That's it.\n",
      "0:44:34 Okay. Do you have any plans or any specific strategy for dividing your work between the laptop and the phone?\n",
      "0:44:46 I don't have a strategy, I would say.\n",
      "0:44:48 But I would say that if I write a big email or an email to an investor, I always do it on the computer.\n",
      "0:44:55 If I write like a quick message, it's always on phone.\n",
      "0:45:01 I got very ready. Sometimes I use Slack on both.\n",
      "0:45:06 It's normally more official stuff on the laptop and more unofficial stuff on the phone.\n",
      "0:45:16 Okay.\n",
      "0:45:21 Yeah, then I had questions about your growth and before I turned on the mic, you said difficult times and obviously with energy crisis and unrest and all of that.\n",
      "0:45:33 Not an easy time, but on the other hand, it could be also a good time for you.\n",
      "0:45:40 It could. Let's see. I don't know.\n",
      "0:45:43 Right now, I'm just kind of taking every day as it comes and seeing what happens.\n",
      "0:45:48 I see potential or I see that there's an opportunity for us.\n",
      "0:45:52 We are experimenting with a few things. We have some good board members on board.\n",
      "0:46:02 And we have our lead investor and we need a couple of hundred thousand more and then we can close our round.\n",
      "0:46:08 And then things will be a little bit more settled in terms of not having to keep your head above water.\n",
      "0:46:16 And last time you talked about as part of that, as I understood it, as part of that process, maybe considering bringing cryptocurrency investments on board.\n",
      "0:46:24 And then I assume that's kind of out of the picture at the moment.\n",
      "0:46:27 I mean, to be honest with you, we also change with the wind a little bit in terms of who we're talking to.\n",
      "0:46:32 So one of the investors that we were talking to back then, he was like, yeah, we can do like cryptocurrency with the EarthMound stuff.\n",
      "0:46:39 And yeah, I don't know. It's also like we could if we wanted to, but depending on who you're talking to, I think it's depending on what we said.\n",
      "0:46:50 And at the moment, crypto is not the best market.\n",
      "0:46:54 So you, not you, but we have to adapt depending on the environment and tell a different story depending on who it is that we're talking to.\n",
      "0:47:05 So considering the way you organize things now as a small company and the prospect for growth, would you say there's kind of a tipping point for when you need, when you cannot no longer manage to have everything in your head?\n",
      "0:47:23 I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I think normally I can manage up to around 10 people with it all in my head. And then it starts to get a little like, OK, I don't have time to.\n",
      "0:47:39 And I don't know whether it's organization or whether it's the fact that I just don't have time and I need to find someone else who can help me do it.\n",
      "0:47:49 So I would say maybe 10 people plus. And right now you're how many are you?\n",
      "0:47:53 Now we are 70. OK. So there's still space.\n",
      "0:47:59 Yeah, there's still space. Only just. Still space. But let's see if it finally just pries my brain. Who knows?\n",
      "0:48:09 Let's talk about the tracking outwards. Obviously, you need to know some basic stuff about what is working, what is not and who is, at least how many is joining the platform and so on.\n",
      "0:48:24 Can you tell me a little bit about how you monitor that?\n",
      "0:48:28 Yes, we use App Store, Google Play Store to manage or monitor the downloads. And then basically we use Microsoft Google Sheets to get an overview of the hotels we have on board who advertise our product.\n",
      "0:48:50 And then we use our banking partners infrastructure to see how many people are buying tickets. We download reports based on this.\n",
      "0:49:01 And do you merge these types of data or do they just, you know, come out separate?\n",
      "0:49:08 It depends. They come out separate, but then we can merge them. Right. So we can say, OK, well, user acquisition costs for this month was X and we made Y.\n",
      "0:49:20 Yeah. So often we do them individually and then we just kind of look at it differently, because I think the problem is if you just look at data without taking into any other factors, such as maybe that month there was, I don't know, there was a fire at the airport.\n",
      "0:49:41 So less people traveled or whatever. Or, yeah, like, for example, actually, today we have like a scan QR code that we sent to the hotels.\n",
      "0:49:54 And I spoke to that hotel this morning because all of a sudden, like in May, June, July, we were like really up and people were buying a lot of stuff and then all of a sudden, boom, just dropped off.\n",
      "0:50:05 And I thought, OK, what's going on? And so I thought, leave it a little bit. And then it turns out that they were using the wrong QR code.\n",
      "0:50:13 They were using an old frame that we don't use anymore. So then it didn't get tracked.\n",
      "0:50:23 So these kind of external things obviously can affect the data. And we're not that big, I would say, enough that it makes sense that we really run sort of automized data reviewing systems.\n",
      "0:50:39 No, it's not like once per month you have like a full review of whatever. It's just you keep tabs on it every now and then.\n",
      "0:50:47 It's always open on my laptop. So I have four, maybe five things that are always open.\n",
      "0:50:54 One is App Store, the other one is Google Play Store, how to like referral things, and then maybe like LinkedIn.\n",
      "0:51:02 OK. Do you have any like positive or negative experiences associated with that tracking? I mean, maybe let's take the example of the QR code, which I guess, you know, has not provided data or has not provided.\n",
      "0:51:23 They have not provided the up-to-date data. Sometimes it's hard to track.\n",
      "0:51:35 Like, for example, right now we average like 350 people a month who download the app, which is quite OK, considering we don't spend any money on marketing.\n",
      "0:51:44 So, yeah. So from my perspective, I think knowing sometimes where some of those downloads come from, because we can see it like from hotels and stuff, and we can see it on Google Analytics, but it just doesn't really make sense.\n",
      "0:52:01 So I'm like, OK, where are these downloads coming from? Why is it this? Why is it that? Why is it that?\n",
      "0:52:06 Yeah. And what does that show? And why is it? I think sometimes like word of mouth, OK, just go download the app, means that you kind of just lose the data.\n",
      "0:52:20 Yes. Because I can only track around 100 of the downloads. Yeah. And then 250 of them?\n",
      "0:52:27 The rest you don't know. You have no clue. I have no clue. And no possibility of knowing where they come from or how they come.\n",
      "0:52:34 A little bit like we can see if they come from a website, but even so, it doesn't make up the numbers.\n",
      "0:52:39 No. OK. So, yeah. So I think data and insights, of course, is always good to have a look at.\n",
      "0:52:47 But I think it only comes into real value once you hit a certain level.\n",
      "0:52:53 So, for example, as a small startup, does it make sense that we pay for a data servicing tracking platform?\n",
      "0:53:01 Yeah. No, not really. Does it make sense that we set it up? Yeah. Do we look at it every now and then?\n",
      "0:53:06 Yes, I think it's good. But in terms of like making key decisions on which direction to go, honestly, we're just not there.\n",
      "0:53:15 No. Like it just doesn't make sense that we say, well, all of the data is pushing this way.\n",
      "0:53:20 I would say one thing that does that has been good about collecting the data is that we know that we should get people pre-travel.\n",
      "0:53:29 So the anxiety of people going, shit, how am I going to get from the airport to the hotel really triggers individuals.\n",
      "0:53:37 And so, for example, Band Hostel in Copenhagen, they do that. So they have a booking confirmation email.\n",
      "0:53:43 They send out about our app and people download our app. And it's one of the top performing.\n",
      "0:53:48 So we know that's something that really makes sense. But at the same time, did we need data to really show that or did we just need common sense?\n",
      "0:54:02 But then again, could we get common sense without having that insight?\n",
      "0:54:06 Is it important for your communication with possible investors to be able to provide hard data?\n",
      "0:54:18 Yeah, I think so, because they need to know where their money is going to go.\n",
      "0:54:21 So if I say to them, hey, we're going to pump money into a big campaign in the middle of Kongsnytro about Skibetappen for tourists,\n",
      "0:54:29 they're going to be like, OK, why are you doing that? And if I said, where instead of I say to them, hey, we're going to spend 50,000 Danish crowns on targeting EasyJet customers,\n",
      "0:54:42 being on their boarding passes before they come to Copenhagen, because we've identified that's the best place to do this.\n",
      "0:54:48 And it makes sense. Investors always want the wine. So that's important for them.\n",
      "0:54:57 So the customer acquisition costs, the lifetime value, what is some of the behavior? I think that comes as we grow.\n",
      "0:55:06 And I think naturally as an organization, once we grow, we get more insights and data becomes more of a prominent factor.\n",
      "0:55:17 Whether I think for younger businesses, startups, you need data. If you had like, stop me, OK, if I'm monologuing, but you have like startup development track,\n",
      "0:55:33 you had like idea phase, proof of concept phase, MVP stage, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you need to, your data sources or your data relevance changes and sources change.\n",
      "0:55:47 So when you're in idea phase, you need data on customer behavior. You need to say, tourists and travelers find it really difficult to get around public transport in Copenhagen.\n",
      "0:55:57 Idea phase, data proves it. Stage two, OK, going out, getting proof of concept, like with a product, going and talking to the people, OK, do they want this solution?\n",
      "0:56:08 The data says it, but can we prove it? OK, I need to collect data on what our users say. Our users say, we really like the fact that this exists, this is a real problem, yada, yada, yada.\n",
      "0:56:18 Cool, next stage. Stage three, MVP wise, can you make a business out of this? Start bringing in such metrics as like customer acquisition costs, lifetime value, return on investment, all of these things.\n",
      "0:56:34 So I think, as I say, as the startup or the company grows, so does its need for different forms of data. And data becomes more prominent in terms of decision making as you grow as an organization.\n",
      "0:56:46 Yeah, makes sense. Perfect sense. Is there any data that you don't have that you would count as relevant data?\n",
      "0:56:54 I would say user data in terms of how they interact with the app. So we don't track, because we just don't, we haven't had the time and or money to implement it.\n",
      "0:57:04 We don't track where the users are pressing in the app. I would like to, so I know, OK, what features make sense and what doesn't. And is this user flow good? Is it not?\n",
      "0:57:16 Are they experiencing any bugs? They're stopping and putting money onto their card. So, yeah, I would like to have that.\n",
      "0:57:25 I would say that's kind of the next step as well, right? Like, OK, now we have customers. So we have people paying for a product, buying tickets and we are in kind of MVP stage.\n",
      "0:57:39 Right. But now we're moving on again to the next stage of the business, which is proof of business. So now I need to go, OK, well, we know that some people are willing to pay for it.\n",
      "0:57:49 But how do we make sure that now this group of people that are willing to pay for it get bigger and bigger and bigger?\n",
      "0:57:55 And the only way to do that is through marketing is one of them, but also creating a strong product that works.\n",
      "0:58:06 So you keep those that are already in there. Keep those and expand. Yes. Referral is the cheapest form of marketing.\n",
      "0:58:15 Yes. Do you need data about like personal data about the users? Would that make any difference?\n",
      "0:58:24 We do collect some personal data in terms of the email and looking at their nationality because we need it for the KYC or a banking partner does.\n",
      "0:58:38 But the banking registration in order to host their money, for them to create like a mini bank account, we need to have that.\n",
      "0:58:47 And that kind of helps us to know, OK, what are the what are the I would say like.\n",
      "0:58:59 What kind of cultures understand the term of like the digital public transport? Yeah. Because for us, for maybe me and you and also people living in London and maybe Paris as well,\n",
      "0:59:15 and all of these other cities that have a card, maybe they would get it. But maybe there's cities where there is no card.\n",
      "0:59:21 Yeah. And they're like, yeah, you know, and we do see that a lot of the people that top up are European.\n",
      "0:59:33 So I think there's that kind of cultural insights that are also relevant.\n",
      "0:59:40 Yeah. And then I imagine if you are to move into to the direction of using EarthMiles to shop at your local grocery store or cafe or whatever,\n",
      "0:59:52 then more detailed user data would become interesting.\n",
      "0:59:59 Yeah, definitely. Yeah. And we also do track like user data.\n",
      "1:00:16 So we do kind of track like user data where we're not tracking it, but we allow people to.\n",
      "1:00:23 This is what we would like. They can self-report something. So if they like something or like if they want to see something.\n",
      "1:00:29 So let's say you want to see you're on holiday with your husband. Right.\n",
      "1:00:33 Right. You want to have a romantic getaway in Rome and you want to see the top place places for couples.\n",
      "1:00:38 Like the romantic. You press this. You press go explore. And then we return the top romantic places for you to go in the city.\n",
      "1:00:47 That's not very romantic, but still, you get my point. And how did you get, you know, how do you get these suggestions?\n",
      "1:00:55 Do they come from somewhere else from TripAdvisor? No, no, no.\n",
      "1:00:59 These are just these have been done both through our own addings and also the community.\n",
      "1:01:05 So travelers who visited and also from. So collaborative filtering. Exactly.\n",
      "1:01:11 Yeah. OK. So other couples will help other couples out. OK. Other vegans will help other vegans.\n",
      "1:01:17 Right. And it's mainly targeted towards. Yeah. Towards tourists and travelers.\n",
      "1:01:25 So that's the reason why we have it. So you track their interests.\n",
      "1:01:28 We don't we don't track the interest, but we we could do.\n",
      "1:01:32 Yes. Because basically what you see is that every time I give I was to the best tacos in town.\n",
      "1:01:39 And then if I was going on it, I could see what interests have been tagged.\n",
      "1:01:43 Yeah. So this is something that. And then here we have like around 3000 different local places, inspiration across different cities.\n",
      "1:01:54 Right. And so what are your thoughts on, you know, moving increasingly in that direction?\n",
      "1:02:02 So what I'm doing, I can show you an exclusive I can show you, but we're basically we've built the EarthMiles app to basically attract the average day user.\n",
      "1:02:18 Yeah. So it works very much similar to the skipper card. Yes.\n",
      "1:02:21 EarthMiles card. And then basically you have your own EarthMiles member and then you can just take different rewards depending on how many and spend your EarthMiles points.\n",
      "1:02:33 Right. Right. So. So it works very similar to what we have now, where you have your you top up your card and you can use it all for all types of mobility.\n",
      "1:02:46 Yeah. And then when you're traveling on sustainable transport, you then just have these different options.\n",
      "1:02:51 Obviously, that should be different images once it's live. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. Yes.\n",
      "1:02:58 So but the issue is so so we will be able to and I'm thinking about adding some filtering in some of the rewards.\n",
      "1:03:08 So, for example, if family is really important to you, OK, I want to get discounts on my family on stuff to do with my family while I'm just taking the metro to work.\n",
      "1:03:17 Yes. Or whatever. Yes. So personalized discounts. I think that would also be really cool.\n",
      "1:03:25 But what we're also looking at right now is actually just doing this. So just having this. And then whenever you open up like the dot app or with the Riser Gordon Riser plane app coming, this will be like a part of the dot app.\n",
      "1:03:44 So we don't have to worry about the ticketing or worry about the transport, the journey planning. It would automatically fit into. Exactly. So let's say you're in the dot app.\n",
      "1:03:55 You would press this button in your Earth miles and then you would just be redirected to our app where we would just be providing discounts.\n",
      "1:04:03 Yeah. We're also exploring that as a potential revenue rather than trying to do it all ourselves, because the issue is if we do it like this, we start competing with Riser Gordon and then they get pissed.\n",
      "1:04:15 Yeah. So we need to also balance. Do you have any red lines in terms of tracking user data?\n",
      "1:04:22 I don't like to sell it. I don't want to sell that data. I think that's really something that I think more and more people are moving away from.\n",
      "1:04:35 And I think that we should not make the person the product in that sense. You know, like the business model around this has nothing to do with tracking people.\n",
      "1:04:49 And I think it shouldn't. Yeah. Like, yeah, I just think it's people and people, people are going to move more and more away from it.\n",
      "1:04:58 And I think become more and more concerned about it. So training to create a business model now where it's centered around user data is a stupid idea.\n",
      "1:05:07 Because it's even on the App Store. So they put out a new trying thing, like they haven't created anything that's perfect, but they have brought out an update where they say they're trying to make it more private for users.\n",
      "1:05:26 Yeah. For everyone else apart from that.\n",
      "1:05:28 Yes.\n",
      "1:05:29 They're also.\n",
      "1:05:30 Exactly.\n",
      "1:05:31 They're also about to go into health insurance because they have all of this data on people's Apple Watches.\n",
      "1:05:35 And so for the next interview, I should be able to show you where your data goes from the skid pad.\n",
      "1:05:43 So you know who is lurking in the background. When it's not you, obviously it will be big tech.\n",
      "1:05:49 And they're everywhere. Pretty much. I mean, now we have a pretty big database still in process of analysis, but they are everywhere.\n",
      "1:06:00 So it's more difficult to know where they are exactly with Apple. And maybe they are in less places, but they're still with Apple.\n",
      "1:06:08 And sometimes for legitimate reasons, right? So it can be functionality or security or whatever, but you don't know.\n",
      "1:06:16 Or making sure they've got their cut. Like banking apps, for example. Apple is like, okay, you're not the only one, so you're going to get this area.\n",
      "1:06:30 We're also one piece of this pie, right?\n",
      "1:06:32 Yes. Exactly. Now we spent an hour talking. You're a busy man. No, it's interesting. Do you have five more minutes?\n",
      "1:06:44 Yeah, I have nothing. I have to go home and see my child. But apart from that, I don't want to keep you too long.\n",
      "1:06:53 I just want to probe a little bit on the financial tracking just in preparation for a third interview.\n",
      "1:06:58 You have a banking app. And last time you told me that you have Danske Bank.\n",
      "1:07:02 I have three banking apps. Not that I'm massively in debt. It's more like I have my British account, my Danish account, and I also have the business account.\n",
      "1:07:12 So I have Revolut, Adwest, and Danske Bank.\n",
      "1:07:16 And you told me that maybe you're checking your bank accounts a little bit more. You told me that in the beginning.\n",
      "1:07:21 How? Do you track systematically?\n",
      "1:07:24 No. I look at my account and go, hmm, I spend a little bit too much money. Sometimes I do.\n",
      "1:07:31 Do you try to figure out how you spend the money?\n",
      "1:07:34 Only when my – okay, so no is the answer, the short answer. I don't really. I just look at my account and go, okay, do I have enough money for the next month that's coming or do I need to move some money around or whatever.\n",
      "1:07:50 And then I do some calculations and so I'm like, okay, well, this happened.\n",
      "1:07:55 And then also there was a point where my girlfriend felt like she was spending a lot of money on stuff and I said, welcome to Denmark.\n",
      "1:08:04 But I said to her, okay, cool. Let's just look at how much money we're spending on groceries.\n",
      "1:08:13 Because she thought that I should owe her money for it.\n",
      "1:08:17 And I said, hey, I'm spending just as much as you are. You can see. But you just don't realize it because I'm not talking about it per se. I'm not like, can you mobile pay me 200 kroner?\n",
      "1:08:27 I'm just like, just buy it. And then we're family.\n",
      "1:08:33 But in order to set up the household, there was actually a point where knowing a little bit more detail was useful.\n",
      "1:08:41 At the end of the month, I think, because she started to say something like, maybe I should pay you less for the rent.\n",
      "1:08:49 And I was like, why? And I think that's also interesting where you really start to see people is when there's less money in their account.\n",
      "1:08:57 Like what type of people they are. And not saying that my girlfriend is a bad person, just saying that I think she kind of got a little bit like, fuck, I'm spending a lot of money.\n",
      "1:09:10 And I need to reduce it. And then she obviously, as soon as you start doing that, you start saying, OK, well, maybe he's not paying his share.\n",
      "1:09:18 Or maybe I'm paying a lot and he's not. And that was the only time that I tracked it.\n",
      "1:09:24 And I don't say anything. I don't say anything to her like, oh, this month I spent X amount on groceries.\n",
      "1:09:31 Because I think after I told her, hey, you can see you actually owe me 2000 kroner because I've spent more money than you have.\n",
      "1:09:38 Then she was like, maybe I shouldn't say anything. I think she realized that I am also putting my hand in my pocket.\n",
      "1:09:49 So I think that's the only time that I've tracked. But apart from that, I do open my banking apps and just check, OK, has the money come in?\n",
      "1:09:56 Has this, what is this?\n",
      "1:09:59 But it's not a systematic kind of thing. It's just, you know.\n",
      "1:10:03 I check if my money's coming when I get paid. Just because I'm old fashioned like that.\n",
      "1:10:09 OK, how broke am I today? Ah, there's less brokenness.\n",
      "1:10:14 Yeah. Does your banking, your private banking app, does it allow for dividing funds into specific spending areas?\n",
      "1:10:25 That's how you see. For example, that's how we did the thing with my girlfriend and the groceries.\n",
      "1:10:30 It's a bit more sometimes. I think sometimes it was like I've spent a couple hundred kroner on a new hat or something.\n",
      "1:10:40 And then I didn't, but it's just an example. And then it said groceries.\n",
      "1:10:45 Yeah. OK, so it's not necessarily accurate. No. Because it classifies by itself. Yeah.\n",
      "1:10:51 OK. OK. Let's leave it at there.\n",
      "1:10:56 What do you think? You haven't. I see your brain ticking about something.\n",
      "1:11:03 No, there's so much. The whole sustainability and the good life, you know, we started there last time.\n",
      "1:11:12 And you have these ideas about stuff that is excess. And now you also talk about data that is excess and, you know, and tipping points and stuff.\n",
      "1:11:22 I think next time we'll talk about that. And maybe I'd like to talk to you about when data can become a source of good and when technology can become a source of good.\n",
      "1:11:34 And, you know, a little bit more about that sustainability thing, which is which seems like a political thing for you.\n",
      "1:11:41 Yeah. Yeah. I would say that I'm very quite socialist in that way.\n",
      "1:11:46 Yes. Yes. But I'm also, I would say, in a unique position to be a socialist.\n",
      "1:11:52 You know what I mean? Like I'm not. I'm not the bottom end of society.\n",
      "1:12:00 So, yeah, like it's always OK to be a socialist when you don't have to really worry about stuff so much.\n",
      "1:12:10 Of course, I do worry, but I know I'll be OK. You know, so I think, yeah, I think it does.\n",
      "1:12:19 It does definitely play a role in my thoughts with regards to my everyday.\n",
      "1:12:25 And I don't want to just create a business just for making money. But I'm also aware that I have to live in a capitalist society where we do have to make money.\n",
      "1:12:36 Yes. So, yes. But I think I think this is the thing for me. I think I can combine both.\n",
      "1:12:44 Yeah. I think I can make money, make my own business, but also create impact.\n",
      "1:12:51 That's why I'm doing this stuff. Yes. Yes. I want to talk more about that next.\n",
      "1:12:59 And maybe pick your brains also about I'm developing this concept, communal welfare for a different project, but one that actually has sustainability stuff going on.\n",
      "1:13:12 So I'll be able to say a little bit more about that next time around. And I suspect you would have some.\n",
      "1:13:18 Can you give like a one sentence on this? I can think. Yes.\n",
      "1:13:22 So the way data is framed as an opportunity, but also a problem for welfare today is by talking about automated decision making systems that are put into core welfare services.\n",
      "1:13:35 So like who gets to get payouts, welfare benefits and stuff and all the kinds of problems that can be associated with that and all the kinds of efficiency that might also be associated with, you know,\n",
      "1:13:49 implementing various forms of machine learning on data that is already there.\n",
      "1:13:53 In contrast to that, I think we need to talk about welfare, not just in terms of that, like rights and fairness and accountability, but also as something that enables good living.\n",
      "1:14:05 And so by communal welfare, I'm targeting as a complementary case, you know, sustainable urban spaces, smart energy systems, smart transportation, stuff that does not need to target specific individuals.\n",
      "1:14:27 But that might speak into the common good and provide welfare for everybody based on data. I'm not quite sure.\n",
      "1:14:36 So like data for good. Something like that.\n",
      "1:14:38 But I mean, I think just to quickly say, I think there's also like there is the data, you know, like, for example, social impact bonds, these kind of social impact indicators and all of this jazz and measuring impact.\n",
      "1:14:54 I think that is like a way to towards looking at these different areas. So it could be smart transport.\n",
      "1:15:03 OK, what does smart transport do? You look at e-scooters. E-scooters are green, but they're not because they last like nine months and then they end up getting thrown out.\n",
      "1:15:13 So but at the same time, that's also something that we want to circumvent through our app if we do the Earth-Miles thing anyway.\n",
      "1:15:24 My point is, is that I think getting big data or like data for good can be interesting, but I also think it's up against a big marketing machine.\n",
      "1:15:44 And that's the problem is that sometimes look at Brexit. Sometimes the facts are there in front of you. Right. And you still do the wrong thing.\n",
      "1:15:55 And now people have to live with that. So, I mean, that's also an interesting case.\n",
      "1:16:03 I think it's a common one. Brexit. Plunging your country into debt, disarray.\n"
